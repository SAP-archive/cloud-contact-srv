# Important Notice
We have decided to stop the maintenance of this public GitHub repository.

SAP HANA Cloud Platform Samples - cloud-contact-srv
========

This repository is a _descendant_ of the [Enterprise Granny](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-enterprise-granny) application. In fact, it's the result of breaking down the *Enterprise Granny* app into three sub-modules:
* contact-srv-api
* contact-srv-provider
* contact-srv-client

The whole purpose of this repo is to demonstrate how-to develop _microservices_ using the
Java runtime of SAP HANA Cloud Platform.


Quick start
-----------

Clone the repo, `git clone https://github.com/SAP/cloud-contact-srv.git`, or [download the latest release](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-contact-srv/archive/master.zip).

Versioning
----------

For transparency and insight into our release cycle, and for striving to maintain backward compatibility, the SAP HANA Cloud Platform -Samples project will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible.

Releases will be numbered with the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor and patch)
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor (and resets the patch)
* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch

For more information on SemVer, please visit http://semver.org/
